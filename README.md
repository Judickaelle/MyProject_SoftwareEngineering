# MyProject_SoftwareEngineering
creation of a web site for the association Ent'raid ESAIP.
This association is created since 2017 and still doesn't have any web site because of lake of time. 
That's why having the opportunity to do one in that context, I have asked the association if they were interested in this project.
The answer is yes.
For the moment the association have only a facebook page.

I am going to use some html, css and javascript file. In order to code, i am used to use notepad++ so i will keep going on using this tool.
To help me in that task, i am going to use w3school and bootstrap. The CSS and Javascipt file already existe so I will do it faster. As this is 
only my second project in html, I think this is important for me to use every help as possible.
